we can replace 
COPY ./start-up.sh /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
RUN chmod +x /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/start-up.sh
with
COPY .init.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
and then
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO dbowner;
but the above didn't worked on line 8 of init.sql

we can follow the steps below to fix this
steps - 
1. go to postgres container
2. login as super user i.e pssql -U posgres <db-name>
3. run this command GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO <role-name>;
4. login as <user> to which the above role is attached to 
5. now you'll be able to perform crud operations

# inside init.sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE dotndockdb TO abhishek; 
ALTER DATABASE dotndockdb OWNER TO dbowner; 
the above two didn't worked as  
they will make this user temporary owner with only create access no read access on any table

Add these to dockerfile or pass in via docker run command if we don't wanna create a user and database from initial script
ENV POSTGRES_USER abhishek
ENV POSTGRES_PASSWORD docker
ENV POSTGRES_DB docker

Postgres commands 
\d - list table relations
\l - list tables
\zl tablename - verify access levels on table
\du - list all the users
\c databasename - connect to database
\q - exit of psql
ctrl + shift + L - clear psql console
